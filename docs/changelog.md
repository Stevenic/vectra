## v0.15.0

Performance, a bug fix, and a wave of dependency updates. All Vectra API surface changes are additive and non-breaking; one direct runtime dependency (`openai`) had a major version bump that callers using the SDK directly should review.

### Skip-if-unchanged document upsert

`LocalDocumentIndex.upsertDocument` now hashes `text + docType + metadata` (canonicalized, SHA-256) and stores the hash on the catalog. When a caller re-upserts a URI whose content + metadata are byte-identical to what's already stored, the call returns a `LocalDocument` handle without re-chunking or re-embedding.

**Who is affected:** Callers that drive Vectra in a "scan every file, upsert each one" sync pattern. No-op syncs against unchanged corpora drop from O(chunks) embedding calls per pass to zero. Measured: a 100-file periodic sync that previously grew to ~505s of pure re-embed overhead now finishes in well under a second when nothing has changed.

**Backward compatibility:** Public API is unchanged. An old catalog (no hash field) bootstraps on first upsert per URI, then short-circuits on subsequent identical upserts. The on-disk catalog gains an optional `uriToHash` map (JSON) / `uri_to_hash` field (protobuf, tag 5) — old readers ignore unknown fields. No catalog version bump.

**Opt-out:** Pass `{ force: true }` as the fifth argument to bypass the check (e.g., after rotating embeddings models):

```ts
await docs.upsertDocument(uri, text, docType, metadata, { force: true });
```

### Internal performance improvements

A set of non-breaking optimizations to hot paths. No API changes beyond the new `deleteItems` helper; all existing tests pass without modification.

- **`beginUpdate` no longer deep-clones vectors.** The transactional snapshot is now a shallow copy of the items array. For an index with N chunks × D-dimensional vectors, this saves O(N·D) memory copy per `upsertItem` / `upsertDocument`. Internally, upsert now replaces items rather than mutating them so the previously-committed snapshot stays intact on `cancelUpdate`.
- **`queryItems` uses a bounded min-heap for top-K.** Distance ranking is now O(N log K) instead of O(N log N), and avoids allocating an N-sized intermediate distance array.
- **`queryItems` loads external metadata files in parallel.** Top-K metadata reads now use `Promise.all` instead of awaiting each file sequentially.
- **`deleteDocument` removes all chunks in a single pass.** New public method `LocalIndex.deleteItems(ids: Iterable<string>)` does a single `filter` over the items array. `LocalDocumentIndex.deleteDocument` now uses this, dropping chunk-removal cost from O(N·M) to O(N) for a document with M chunks in an index of N total chunks.

### Bug fix: FolderWatcher crash on Windows with 8.3 short-name paths

`FolderWatcher.start()` now resolves each watched path through `fs.realpath` before handing it to `fs.watch`. Previously, watching a path containing a Windows 8.3 short name (e.g., anything under `os.tmpdir()` when the user's home dir maps to a `STEVEN~1`-style alias) would crash the process with a libuv assertion (`!_wcsnicmp` in `fs-event.c`) the first time `ReadDirectoryChangesW` returned an event filename in long-name form. The watcher also no longer uses `fs.watch(..., { recursive: true })`; it walks the tree on start and installs one non-recursive watcher per directory, dynamically adding/removing watchers as subdirectories appear or disappear. Both fixes are internal — no API changes — but URIs stored in the index for paths that contained short names will now be in their canonical long-name form.

### Bug fix: stale norm after `upsertItem`

`LocalIndex.upsertItem` previously updated the item's `vector`, `metadata`, and `metadataFile` but kept the **old precomputed norm**. Any upsert that changed the vector would leave behind a norm that no longer matched, skewing every subsequent cosine-similarity ranking against that item until it was deleted and re-inserted.

The fix is a one-line addition in the upsert replacement path that also recomputes `norm` from the new vector. Indexes built with affected versions will self-heal on the next upsert per item; if you suspect query results are off and you've been upserting items in place, force a refresh via `upsertItem` (or, for documents, `upsertDocument(..., { force: true })`).

### Dependency updates

Major-version runtime dependencies — review your direct usage if any:

- `openai` 4.104.0 → 6.33.0
- `@huggingface/transformers` 3.8.1 → 4.0.1
- `dotenv` 16.5.0 → 17.4.1
- `protobufjs` 7.5.4 → 8.0.0
- `uuid` 11.1.0 → 13.0.0
- `yargs` 17.7.2 → 18.0.0

Minor / patch runtime updates:

- `wink-nlp` 2.3.2 → 2.4.0
- `cheerio` 1.0.0 → 1.2.0
- `turndown` 7.2.0 → 7.2.4

Dev / tooling:

- `typescript` 5.8.3 → 5.9.3
- `eslint` 10.1.0 → 10.2.0
- `mocha` 11.2.2 → 11.7.5
- `nyc` 17.1.0 → 18.0.0
- `webpack-cli` 6.0.1 → 7.0.2
- `@types/node` 22.15.11 → 25.5.2
- `@types/uuid` 10.0.0 → 11.0.0
- `@types/yargs` 17.0.33 → 17.0.35

GitHub Actions:

- `actions/checkout` 4 → 6
- `actions/setup-node` 4 → 6
- `actions/deploy-pages` 4 → 5
- `actions/upload-pages-artifact` 3 → 5
- `actions/configure-pages` 5 → 6

### Other

- Test scripts now quote the spec glob so all spec files run on Linux CI (previously some shells were expanding the glob too eagerly and missing files).
- `TransformersEmbeddings` now imports `@huggingface/transformers` through an internal loader module (`src/internals/transformersLoader.ts`) instead of inlining the dynamic import. The loader exposes a `_setTransformersLoader` hook for tests to inject mocks — necessary because `@huggingface/transformers` 4.x marks its ESM exports as non-configurable, which broke the prior `sinon.stub(module, 'pipeline')` approach. Production behavior is unchanged.

## v0.14.x

### Breaking: fetch() replaces axios

All HTTP requests now use the built-in `fetch()` API instead of [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). This removes axios as a dependency and eliminates third-party code from the HTTP request path.

**Who is affected:** Projects that relied on axios interceptors or custom axios configuration passed through Vectra's HTTP layer.

**Migration:** Remove any axios-specific customization. If you need to customize requests, use the `requestConfig` option (a standard `RequestInit` object) on `OpenAIEmbeddings`:

```ts
const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
  apiKey: '...',
  model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
  requestConfig: {
    headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'value' },
  },
});
```

### Breaking: Node.js 22.x minimum

The minimum Node.js version is now **22.x** (up from 20.x). This is driven by the `undici@8.0.0` transitive dependency which requires `node >=22.19.0`.

**Who is affected:** Projects running Node.js 20.x or earlier.

**Migration:** Upgrade to Node.js 22.x LTS. Node.js 20.x reached end-of-life on March 26, 2026.
